# 🌐 OpenAI API Integration Guide

This project demonstrates how to use the OpenAI API to access powerful AI models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, DALL·E, Whisper, and Embeddings for building intelligent applications.

---

## 📌 Introduction

The **OpenAI API** provides developers with seamless access to cutting-edge AI models that can understand, generate, and transform natural language, code, and images. With simple integration, you can empower your application with intelligent features like conversation, summarization, image generation, and more.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This guide and codebase aim to:
- Help developers get started with the OpenAI API
- Demonstrate how to generate completions and chat responses
- Provide key information about the Playground, Function Calling, RAG, and Code Interpreter
- Serve as a reference for building intelligent and interactive applications

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 Generate and set OpenAI API Key
- 📋 Fetch and list available OpenAI models using `openai.models.list()`
- 💬 Use of `openai.ChatCompletion.create()` to interact with chat-based models
- 🧪 Exploration of OpenAI Playground features like temperature, top_p, frequency penalty
- 🛠️ Function Calling with structured responses
- 🧠 Overview of advanced features like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Code Interpreter
- 📄 Responses parsed and printed cleanly using Python
