# ðŸ§  OpenAI API & LangChain Integration Guide

This project provides a comprehensive walkthrough of using OpenAI's latest models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) through Python, including advanced concepts like Function Calling, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and LangChain integration.

---

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Introduction

This guide demonstrates how to leverage OpenAI's powerful language models and integrate them into Python applications. It covers core API usage, function calling, prompt engineering, and real-time data extraction using tools like SerpAPI and Wikipedia through LangChain.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ 2. Purpose

The goal of this project is to help developers:
- Understand and use OpenAI's chat and completion APIs.
- Implement Function Calling for structured data extraction.
- Perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- Use LangChain to connect LLMs with external tools.
- Load documents and create simple chatbot/assistant flows.

---

## âœ¨ 3. Features

- âœ… Use of OpenAI ChatCompletion and Function Calling APIs.
- âœ… JSON extraction using natural language prompts.
- âœ… LangChain setup with prompt templates and chains.
- âœ… Agent-based information retrieval using SerpAPI and Wikipedia.
- âœ… Document loading with PDF support (`pypdf`).
- âœ… Real-world examples: student info extraction, flight details, restaurant name generation, etc.
- âœ… Integration with external APIs and chaining LLMs using LangChain.
