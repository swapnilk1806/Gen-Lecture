# 🔍 OpenAI API & LangChain Demo

## 📘 Introduction

This project is a comprehensive demonstration of using OpenAI's API in conjunction with LangChain to build powerful AI-powered applications. It shows how to use language models like GPT-3.5/GPT-4 to process text, extract structured data, call external functions, and perform real-time information retrieval using tools like SerpAPI and Wikipedia. The project also covers LangChain chains and agents for building complex multi-step workflows.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to help developers understand and implement the following:

- OpenAI API key integration and setup
- Prompting techniques including zero-shot and prompt templates
- Using OpenAI's chat completions and function calling
- Performing information extraction via custom structured functions
- Real-time search using SerpAPI with LangChain agents
- Using LangChain `LLMChain`, `SimpleSequentialChain`, and `SequentialChain` to build intelligent pipelines
