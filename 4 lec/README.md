# LangChain Framework

## Introduction
LangChain is a powerful framework designed for developing applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides tools and abstractions to easily build complex NLP workflows by combining LLMs with prompt templates, chains, agents, memory management, and document loaders. LangChain supports integration with popular LLM providers like OpenAI and Hugging Face, making it a versatile choice for developers building intelligent applications.

## Purpose
The purpose of LangChain is to simplify the development of language model-driven applications by providing a modular and extensible framework. It enables users to:

- Efficiently manage prompts and templates for LLMs.
- Chain multiple LLM calls into workflows.
- Use agents that interact with external tools and APIs.
- Maintain conversational memory across interactions.
- Load and process documents for NLP tasks.

This framework is ideal for building chatbots, virtual assistants, question-answering systems, content generation, and other advanced AI applications.

## Features
- **LLM Integration:** Easily connect to various LLM providers like OpenAI and Hugging Face.
- **Prompt Templates:** Manage and optimize prompts dynamically based on user input.
- **Chains:** Create multi-step workflows that combine prompts and LLM calls.
- **Agents and Tools:** Enable decision-making LLM agents that use external tools (Google Search, Wikipedia, calculators).
- **Memory:** Support conversational memory with different strategies (buffer, window, etc.).
- **Document Loaders:** Load and process documents (PDF, text) for enhanced language model applications.
- **Extensible:** Supports adding custom chains, tools, and memory modules.
- **Examples & Tutorials:** Comes with detailed examples for quick start and experimentation.

## License
LangChain is open source and available under the **MIT License**.
